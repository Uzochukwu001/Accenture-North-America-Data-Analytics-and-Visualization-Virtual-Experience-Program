# Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization Virtual Experience Program (Navigating Numbers).


## A systematic approach in bringing data to life with analytics & visualization using Microsoft Excel and Microsoft PowerPoint.


This is a Virtual Experience Program found and completed on the Forage's website. It helped me to dive deep into the evolving world of data; learning data basics such as data cleaning, modeling, visualization, storytelling etc. as well as understanding what a career in data analytics could look like.. The program is self-paced and typically takes 5-6 hours to complete. Necessary files associated with this program were uploaded which include:

- Completion Certificate: This is the certificate awarded at the completion of this virtual experience program.
- Model PP template: This is the expected design template provided for after-analysis documentation.
- Sample Content: This is a dataset provided for analysis. It was merged with the Sample User dataset to generate insights.
- Sample Location: This is a dataset provided for analysis. It was merged with the Sample User dataset to generate insights.
- Sample Profile: This is a dataset provided for analysis. It was merged with the Sample User dataset to generate insights.
- Sample Reactions: This is a dataset provided for analysis. It was merged with the Sample User dataset to generate insights.
- Sample Reaction Types: This is a dataset provided for analysis. It was merged with the Sample User dataset to generate insights.
- Sample Session: This is a dataset provided for analysis. It was merged with the Sample User dataset to generate insights.
- Sample User: This is the dataset provided for analysis. This is the fact table to which other dimension tables were merged to.
- Solution Social Buzz Table: This is an excel workbook containing worksheets for the merged, transformed and cleaned datasets, pivot tables, and charts respectively.


There were four sections in the program with distinct objectives as well as associated learnable skills, viz:

1. Project Understanding: Here, I quickly got up to speed with the business problem being addressed, the project requirements and analytics team alignment. Practical skills gained from working on this task are Teamwork strategy and Project Planning. 

2. Data Cleaning & Modeling: Here, the datasets were properly modelled, cleaned and transformed to create valuable insights. Practical skills gained from working on this task are Data Understanding and Data Modeling.

3. Data Visualization & Storytelling: Here, appropriate visuals were created and illustrated in details, bringing the data to life and uncovering insights for the business. Practical skills gained from working on this task are Data Analysis, Storytelling and Data Visualization.

4. Data Presentation to the Client: Here, the generated insights were presented to the client for further actions. Practical skills gained from working on this task are Presentation, Communication and Public Speaking.




#### PROJECT UNDERSTANDING.

This section describes the client(Social Buzz) overview and their requirements.

- Client overview: This is a small social media company with little resources for scalability. They need guidance for their IPO coming up the following year and need to learn Big Data Practices from a large corporation standpoint; which is why they outsourced the task to our company(a better experienced data management company).

- Client requirements: They want an audit of their big data practices, an analysis of their content categories(highlighting the top 5 categories in terms of aggregate popularity and our recommendations for a successful IPO. The project was estimated by the company's data analytics team to last for about 3 months.

- Company duties: The company team will be carrying out the following responsibilities
1. Create up-to-date big data best practices presentation.
2. Extract sample datasets from Social Buzz database using SQL.
3. Onsite audit of their data center.
4. Merging of sample dataset tables.
5. Virtual session with Social Buzz team to present previous clients' success stories relevant to them.
6. Prepare best practices document for Social Buzz IPO.
7. Load sample dataset into Accenture Sandbox DB.
8. Technology architecture workshop with Social Buzz data team to understand their technology landscape and stress-testing their technology to identify weak spots.
9. Communicate with previous IPO companies within our client base for reference stories.
10. Analysis of sample datasets with visualizations
11. Full documentation of the process to guide Social Buzz through for IPO.




### DATA CLEANING AND MODELLING.

This section describes all the relevant data merging, cleaning and transformation processes for the different objectives, pivot tables and charts as already carried out in the attached Solution Social Buzz Table workbook. 




#### DATA VISUALIZATION, STORYTELLING AND PRESENTATION.

This section contains PowerPoint slides showing the various charts as solutions for the given objectives as well as observational insights from the charts. Below are the screenshots of the various charts indicating the solutions for the data visualization, storytelling and presentation objectives:

## CONCLUSION

This is a great experience for me and the peak of the whole task for me was the story telling part, where I had to present my analysis to the client. It was an ideal program to learn about the role of a data analyst. The Completion Certificate for this program was uploaded also.
